    "# Recitation 6 -- Numerical Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This recitation is designed to get you re-acquainted with Python ahead of our next lab, and also to introduce you to a few basic schemes one might use in solving a differential equation (like, say, the stellar structure equations...). Derivatives show up all the time in astronomy and physics, and so it is important to have some way to evaluate differential equations with a computer. Next week in lab we'll be using output from a fancy stellar evolution code called [MESA](http://mesa.sourceforge.net/) that will do this much better, but it's good to have some kind of basis before jumping into that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from class the stellar structure equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}M}{\\mathrm{d}r} = 4\\pi r^2 \\rho $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}P}{\\mathrm{d}r} = \\frac{-G M \\rho}{r^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $M$ is the mass contained within a spherical shell of radius $r$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$P$ is the pressure at radius r, and \n",
    "\n",
    "the mass density $\\rho$ is a function of pressure given by $\\rho(P) = (\\frac{P}{K})^{\\frac{n}{n+1}}$, where $K$ is some constant and $n$ is the *polytropic index*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This polytropic index business comes from assuming a relationship between the pressure and the density (which should make some intuitive sense) of the form $P = K\\rho^{1+\\frac{1}{n}}$. Don't worry about it too much for now, it's just a simplification for our modelling scheme that helps us approximate a star. I think Chandrasekhar first came up with the idea, and while new models are fancier (e.g. MESA uses the equation of state such that $P(\\rho)$ is not a polytrope but rather also a function of temperature) this is still a valid method of thinking about things. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more on polytropes and some horrible math, see [here](https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~gk/A403/polytrop.pdf). Aren't you glad we can use computers to integrate things these days?\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I've lightly adapted a simple code I found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Yurlungur/stellar-structure) by Jonah Miller that solves the stellar structure equations numerically given some boundary conditions. Note that this solution assumes equilibrium, and is just a snapshot in time at one particular set of stellar properties -- modern stellar evolution codes like MESA *don't* assume equilibrium, but instead advance the solution in time including nuclear reactions which change the composition of the star and cause it to evolve over the H-R diagram. \n",

The error ~ scales with the step size, which means we have to take *a lot* of steps to make this accurate (which is both computationally expensive and sometimes a bad idea precision-wise). An improvement on forward-Euler are the Runge-Kutta family of integrators. Below is some psuedo-code for a [4th-order Runge-Kutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods) scheme integrating an imaginary differential equation $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{dt}}=f(x,t)$:\n",
