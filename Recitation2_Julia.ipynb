    "**1. What is Julia?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia is a relatively new language developed at MIT that straddles the gap between interpreted and compiled languages, and tries to get the best of both worlds! Interpreted languages (like Python) are often lauded for their relatively low barriers to entry and on-the-fly versatility, but they are *much* slower than \"harder\" compiled languages like C or FORTRAN. Enter Julia, a \"just-in-time\" compiled language with higher-level syntax similar to Python but performance close to C! Julia runs fast natively, with no extra tricks required (say goodbye to vectorizing your slow Python code) and is a robust up-and-coming tool for data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What can I use Julia for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly anything! It's used for scientific research at universities and national labs where high performance computing is a priority, but it is also gaining popularity in a variety of industries, mostly focused on data science applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What will we be doing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this introductory session I hope to introduce to you the foundational skills required to use Julia (and other languages should you choose to learn them), specifically with applications to real science/modelling problems! No prior understanding of coding required--we will learn together as we go!\n",

    "## Starting out\n",
    "\n",
    "You are running Julia out of a Jupyter Notebook right now. I like them because they are easy to mesh text (like this) and code (like you will see below). Let's start by making sure you know how to open Jupyter notebook and saving your work to your personal folder (if you opened this notebook you're probably okay, just make sure you remember how to do it later and ask me if you're having saving issues). You can make Julia programs in any text editor and run them from the command line, something we might explore later, but for now we will work mostly out of notebooks for their ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks have two kinds of cells — code and markdown. This is a markdown cell (which makes text formatting easy and also supports $\\LaTeX$ style math commands). You can change the cell type with the dropdown menu at the top of the page. Markdown cells are useful as notes to accompany your code/explain things.\n",

You can easily just switch the kernel in your Jupyter notebook to Julia and then write solutions/translate Python code to Julia. I also have a twitter bot that simulates three-body problems where most of the work is done in Julia, and you can find that example on my github [here](https://github.com/kirklong/ThreeBodyBot), and a lot of research work I did for an [undergraduate project](https://github.com/kirklong/Research) I did in Julia as well. I'm also happy to help in general, so come to office hours or the Astronomy Help Room while I'm there if there's ever something programming related you think I might be able to help with."
