    "**1. What is Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a *high-level interpreted* programming language. What does this mean? Python's higher-level syntax means that Python code is highly readable and much easier to intuitively understand than many lower-level langauges — this makes it a great language to learn and start your programming journey in! In Python you don't have to use excessive amounts of brackets or deal with many of the other syntax frustrations lower-level langauges often introduce. Python is an interpreted langauge, which means that it's easy to modify programs and run them in real time, but the downside is this makes it significantly slower than a lower level compiled langauge like C or Fortran. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best of both worlds may lie in an up-and-coming language like Julia, which boasts C-like performance but with higher-level Python syntax. Why learn Python then instead of something like Julia? It's still a little easier than Julia, but more importantly it is stabler and used more broadly across fields — making Python perhaps ***the*** most useful language you can learn today. Personally, I do not have any experience with Julia, but I have used Python extensively since I learned about it during my freshman/sophomore year of undegrad. If you wish to use Julia as your preferred language for this course, I will try to help with issues as much as I can, but will probably have to defer to Jason's expertise with Julia (of course Google is always good for debugging, too).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What can I use Python for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly anything! It's used for scientific research at universities and national labs (including NASA!) but it's also used extensively by web developers, game designers, and industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What will we be doing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this introductory session I hope to introduce to you the foundational skills required to use Python (and other languages should you choose to learn them), specifically with applications to real science/modelling problems! No prior understanding of coding required--we will learn together as we go!\n",

    "## Starting out\n",
    "\n",
    "You are running Python out of a Jupyter Notebook right now. I like them because they are easy to mesh text (like this) and code (like you will see below). Let's start by making sure you know how to open Jupyter notebook and saving your work to your personal folder (i.e. directory). If you opened this notebook you're probably okay, just make sure you remember how to do it later and ask me if you're having saving issues. You can make Python programs in any text editor and run them from the command line, something we might explore later, but for now we will work mostly out of notebooks for their ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks have two kinds of cells — code and markdown. This is a markdown cell (which makes text formatting easy and also supports $\\LaTeX$ style math commands). You can change the cell type with the dropdown menu at the top of the page. Markdown cells are useful as notes to accompany your code/explain things.\n",

    "If you want to continue developing this skill and liked the format of this notebook, these notes are based off of an introductory course created by Kirk Long (2nd year grad student in APS). Those course materials (which are mostly notebooks like this with explanations + problems) are freely available on Kirk's [github](https://github.com/kirklong/PrisonOutreach). I'm also happy to help in general, so come to office hours or the Astronomy Help Room (AHR, Duane Room D220) while I'm there (2-4pm on Thursdays) if there's ever something programming related you think I might be able to help with."
