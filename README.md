# ASTR3730_recitation

Course files/labs for the recitation of ASTR 3730: Astrophysics I (Fall 2021)

See the "Recitations" page on Canvas for information about each lab/recitation.

Download all the files by clicking the big green button, or you can clone the repository using command-line (Terminal on Mac):

git clone https://github.com/johnnydorigojones/ASTR3730_recitation.git

However you do it, make sure you download all the files and that you preserve the directory structure wherever you put them. You can also download just the individual files for a given week from that folder, or (if going the command-line route) you can just run git pull in the directory you originally cloned this repository into to get the most up-to-date version.
