# ASTR3730_recitation

Course files/labs for ASTR 3730: Astrophysics I

Download all the files by clicking the big green button, or you can clone the repository using commandline (Terminal on Mac):

git clone https://github.com/johnnydorigojones/ASTR3730_recitation.git

However you do it, make sure you download all the files and that you preserve the directory structure wherever you put them. You can also download just the individual files for a given week from that folder, or (if going the command line route) you can just run git pull in the directory you originally cloned this repository into to get the most up-to-date version. There's now a tutorial video that shows you how to do this! If you're interested in further learning about how to use your terminal (it's a good skill to have!) here's a nice tutorial I followed when I first converted to Linux last year. It's also good to keep a reference of common commands handy like this one.


1st (review) week instructions:

If you plan to do this in Python, make sure you open the Python notebook (ignore the Julia one). You will need the random, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, csv, and scipy packages. I believe those will probably be installed by default if you go the Anaconda route, but if for some reason you're missing any of them I can show you how to install them. If you want to be exceptionally brave and try Julia then you will use the Julia one, but you need to complete the following extra steps:

Download and install Julia

Follow these instructions to make Julia work with Jupyter

Install the DataFrames, Plots, Random, CSV, and FFTW packages. I think everything but (maybe?) FFTW should come pre-installed automatically, but you can add any if they're missing quickly/easily from a Julia session.
