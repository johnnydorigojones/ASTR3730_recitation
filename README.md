# ASTR3730_recitation

Course files/labs for ASTR 3730: Astrophysics I

Download all the files by clicking the big green button, or you can clone the repository using commandline (Terminal on Mac):

git clone https://github.com/johnnydorigojones/ASTR3730_recitation.git

However you do it, make sure you download all the files and that you preserve the directory structure wherever you put them. You can also download just the individual files for a given week from that folder, or (if going the command line route) you can just run git pull in the directory you originally cloned this repository into to get the most up-to-date version.


1st (review) week instructions:

If you plan to do this in Python, make sure you open the Python notebook (ignore the Julia one). You will need the random, matplotlib, numpy, astropy, csv, and scipy packages. I believe those will probably be installed by default if you go the Anaconda route, but if for some reason you're missing any of them I can show you how to install them.
