# ASTR3730_recitation

Course files/labs for recitation of ASTR 3730: Astrophysics I

Download all the files by clicking the big green button, or you can clone the repository using command-line (Terminal on Mac):

git clone https://github.com/johnnydorigojones/ASTR3730_recitation.git

However you do it, make sure you download all the files and that you preserve the directory structure wherever you put them. You can also download just the individual files for a given week from that folder, or (if going the command-line route) you can just run git pull in the directory you originally cloned this repository into to get the most up-to-date version.


2nd recitation (python review) instructions (see Canvas page for details):

Make sure you can open the Python notebook. You will need the following packages: random, matplotlib, numpy, astropy, csv, and scipy. I believe those will all be installed by default with Anaconda, but if for some reason you're missing any of them I can show you how to install them.
